## Navigation built at run-time from a JS array

In the main.js file, you'll find an array called <code>navigation</code>.

In the index.html file, you'll find a header already set up, with navigation links in it.

Your job is to remove those example links (delete them from the html, or comment them), and instead, use JS to generate those elements and place them in the DOM, using the data from the <code>navigation</code> array.

This is how many websites actually work- they don't have the navigation links actually hard-coded into the HTML, they retreive the data about the navigation links, and generate them when they're needed.

Good luck!
